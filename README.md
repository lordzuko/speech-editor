The ability to exert precise control over generated speech is crucial for many applica- tions in which TTS systems are used. Models such as FastSpeech2 do technically offer direct control over F0, energy and duration. However, for users to control these fea- tures, a sensible user interface is required. A HitL system is often limited in its effec- tiveness by the user-friendliness of the provided user interface. Recognizing this, we developed a web-based User Interface (UI) designed specifically for the controllable TTS system. The primary objective of this UI is to bridge the technical complexities of the variance adaptor with a user-friendly interface, enabling users to make meaningful edit to synthesized utterance in a manner which is reliable, interpretable, and faithful to the usersâ€™ intent.
